                        Zutto Mayonaka de Iinoni (ずっと真夜中でいいのに。) meaning "I wish it was midnight all the time"
                        stylized ZUTOMAYO, is a Japanese Rock group that debuted in 2018. The group is secretive and has
                        never released a full member list and has credited different people for each music production.
                        The only recurring member in each song is the woman vocalist named "Aca-Ne (ACAね)" Even though 
                        little information is released, the group is successful and has reached around 2.5 million spotify 
                        listeners around the world. The group has released 2 Albums and 4 EPs and has performed at multiple 
                        concerts during 2022 and 2023.

                        I discovered the ZUTOMAYO group around the end of 2021 and Over the entirety of 2022, they have became
                        my favorite artist, racking up over 20,000 minutes worth of listening throughout the year (around 2 weeks straight).
                        Even though I cannot understand the songs because it is Japanese Rock, I still vibe with the music portion of the song.
                        I try my best to sing along despite the language barrier and I manage to sing their songs during karaoke sessions with my friends. 
                        In the end, I am a loyal supporter to the group and I hope in the future, I am able to travel to Japan to see them.
