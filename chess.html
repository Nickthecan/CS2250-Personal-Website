                        <p style="text-align: center;">
                            I started chess back in elementary school when a group called "Chess Masters" arrived and gave a small talk about the game
                            about chess. I was interested in all the pieces that I saw across the checkerboard layout. The speaker described how chess
                            was more than a game and how it takes strategy, tactics, and psychology to win the game. He then challenged the entire class
                            to one game. The crowd went wild, calling out different pieces to move. I watched from the back as he started taking our pieces
                            one by one, until he checkmated our king. I was astonished by the way he moved his pieces. They all worked together to fight against
                            our fleet. Looking back at it, the class didn't know what to do, since this game was new to all of us. At the end, he told us that they
                            were going to host workshops afterschool to teach us the skills to get better. At this point, I was invested. I decided to go and learn
                            the game of chess.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: center;">
                            At the beginning, I kind of sucked since I didn't know what to do. I knew how all the pieces moved, but other than that, I would be crushed
                            by the other peers that joined the workshop. I got frustrated and decided to stop. I figured that this game was too difficult for someone like
                            me. Growing up, I would always see the 64 squares everywhere I went. At the local toy shop, at convenience stores, and at parks. I went on a cruise
                            with my family and in the entertainment area, there was the board. I decided to play one game, against my father. But in the end I lost. I didn't know
                            why I decided to play again. The game was just calling me.
                        </p>

                            Fast foward many years later, Covid hit and I was bored. I noticed that online, there was a huge boom in the chess community. Many people
                            were playing chess. I didn't understand why the hype was so huge at this time. Probably because of the Netflix series, "The Queen's Gambit".
                            I decided to play another game with a friend who was also excited to play. But this time, it was not over the board like how I usually played. 
                            It was online. The game had set up a timer for both of us; 10 minutes on the clock. We took turns moving the pieces around. I still had some
                            skills from the past that I had implemented into the game and in the end, I won. It felt good. 
                        </p>
                        <!-- Requirement-1.G -->
                        <p style="text-align: center;">
                            I continued to play a few more games but with people
                            from around the world, however they were a lot stronger than me. I decided to search up how to win at this game, because I wanted to have that same
                            feeling from when I beat my friend. Apparently there was a lot more to this game than I thought. There were opening preparations, tactics, and endgame
                            studies that I had never even heard about. But you were suppose to implement all these in order to win. I began to study during the Covid months and
                            once I had a good amount of information in my brain, I began to challenge more people online. Slowly but surely, I began to win. It took around a year 
                            after playing my friend, but I am now in the top 5% of chess players in the world and I continue to improve my skills to be even better. Being a Grandmaster
                            is probably out of reach but I say I am satisfied at where I am at right now, but my journey is far from over.

                            <p>Move 2: This defines the Caro Kann Defense as Black. This is a rare sideline called the "Euwe Attack" where white fianchetto's their Bishop on b2 to have sight on the long diagonal</p>
                            <p>Move 6: Defended the Bishop with the Knight on e7 because in the Caro Kann, the light-squared bishop can be disposed of because the pawns already control the light squares for you</p>
                            <p>Move 8: Played Queen at g5 because they moved their Bishop to a weird square on d3. Moved the Queen to target the g2 pawn and protect the Knight on f5</p>
                            <p>Move 14: Pushed pawn to g6 in order to push my f pawn to f5. However the opponent decided to strike first</p>
                            <p>Move 17: Pushed the h pawn forward to undermine White's structure after they closed the position for the both of us</p>
                            <p>Move 20: Played Rook to h4 to try to invade White's territory. Attacking the pawn on f4 with both my Rook and my Bishop while White only had the Queen to defend the Pawn</p>
                            <p>Move 22: Slid my other Rook over to the h file in order to double up and form a battery. Then I used my Rook on h4 to attack the Queen.</p>
                            <p>Move 23: White made a mistake to block his Queen with their Knight. This pins the Knight to the Queen. Now White cannot move their Knight without losing their Queen</p>
                            <p>Move 24: successfully invaded with my 2 Rooks, taking a free pawn, still continuing to pin White's Knight to their Queen</p>
                            <p>Move 25: After White Castled, it allowed my Queen to get into the action to check the King</p>
                            <p>Move 26: Bishop was brought into the action in order to target the c3 Pawn</p>
                            <p>Move 28: Pushed my f pawn forward in order to get my Rook onto the 3rd Rank</p>
                            <p>Move 30: Had to move my Rook back since they countered the rank with their own Rook</p>
                            <p>Move 32: Big mistake for White by moving the Knight to e5, attacking my useless Knight. The Knight previously protected the h2 square so I slid my h3 Rook to h2 to target his e2 Bishop</p>
                            <p>Move 33: White took my Knight, So I took their Bishop with my e4 Rook. This is the end for White. I have way too many attackers and it is a forced Checkmate in a few moves</p>
                            <p>Move 34: White had no choice to Sacrifice their Queen and resigned after I took the Queen with my Rook. I had won.</p>
